To deactivate the virtual environment and reactivate it to run your Flask application again, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Deactivate the Virtual Environment

1. If your Flask application is currently running, stop it by pressing `CTRL+C` in the terminal.
2. Deactivate the virtual environment by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   deactivate
   ```

### Step 2: Reactivate the Virtual Environment and Run the Flask Application

1. Navigate to the directory where your virtual environment is located (if you have navigated away from it). You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

   ```
   cd path/to/your/project/directory
   ```

2. Reactivate the virtual environment by typing the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   .\env\Scripts\activate

   ```

3. Once the virtual environment is activated, run your Flask application again with the following command:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```
